# argument files
This dir contains argument files that may be useful for running various jobs within the pipeline. Notably, the signal selection files (of which there are many). They are divided per year, but this still results in ~6k jobs per year, so I split them to about 2-3k per year. The signal jobs which failed selection are all located in `signal_selection_jobsToRerun_final.txt`
